# pyledjr (python ledger)

Pyledjr is a simple, free, open-source, python-based personal finace tool, which can automatically download, tranform/clean/combine, and visualise bank transaction data.

This project is a work in progress, stay tuned!

## Features

**Web Scraping**
- Uses the user's bank login credentials (encrypyted for security) to automate downloading of bank transaction data.
- Dependency on ChromeDriver, available at https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads.
- Can be tedious to set this up. Alternative is to manually download transaction history.

**Data Cleaning/Combining**
- Cleans transactions data from each bank account into a consistent format.
- Combines data and removes duplicates.

**Visualisation**
- Not yet implemented.
